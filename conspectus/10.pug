section
  h2 10.1 Know the classification of lipids.
  p
    | Lipids, also known as fats, are important biological molecules found in
    | many roles in the body. One example is the cell membrane in animal cells,
    | formed from one or more layers of primarily lipid molecules.
  p
    | Lipds are soluble in nonpolar solvents and insoluble in water and other polar
    | solvents. Lipids are classified into groups of similar molecules, including
    | fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols,
    | and many more.

section
  h2 10.3 Biological membrane structure and fluid mosaic model
  p
    | As mentioned above, biological membrances are primarily composed of lipids
    | and may form single layer membrances, micelles, or double-layer membranes
    | called liposomes or vesicles.
  p
    | In bilayer cell membranes, the fluid mosaic model is used to explain the structure
    | and behavior of the lipid bilayer. In the fluid mosaic model, a lipid bilayer
    | is embedded with proteins and other structures that can move laterally with ease
    | due to the arrangement of lipid molecules. However, transverse movement requires
    | more energy to flip between the outer membane to the inner or vice versa. In fact,
    | proteins are often two large and require so much energy that they normally
    | never flip.
    | The fluidity of the membrane is determined by temperature, length of the
    | lipid tails, the degree of saturation, and the presence of cholesterol.

section
  h2 10.4 Know the types of membrane proteins.
  p
    | There are a variety of proteins commonly found embedded in cell membranes:
  ul
    li Integral proteins
    li Peripheral proteins
    li Lipid-anchored proteins
  p
    | Integral proteins (IMPs) are strongly embedded proteins found in membranes that can
    | only be removed using detergents, nonpolar solvents, and denaturization. Many integral
    | proteins are transmembrane, but not all. IMPs serve many functions in the membrane,
    | including transport, channels, receptors, and more.
  p
    | Peripheral proteins are weakly embedded proteins that are easier to remove, and
    | therefore they are easier to study. They may attach to IMPs or they may be contained
    | in the peripheral areas of the membrane.
  p
    | Lipid-anchorage proteins, as the name implies, are anchored to the lipids that comprise
    | the membrane bilayer.

section
  h2 10.5 Understand how lipid asymmetry is maintained.
  p
    | The bilayer membrane is asymmetrical, meaning that the inner and outer membranes
    | are structurally different. This asymmetry is important for the functionality
    | of the membrane, as many reactions must happen outside the cell but not inside, or
    | transport must occur in only one direction, etc.
  p
    | Asymmetry is maintained through a number of mechanisms. Proteins for example,
    | cannot rotate across the membrane. During membrane synthesis, new membranes
    | are generated by expanding the existing asymmetric membranes.

section
  h2 10.6 Thermodynamics of transport across the membranes.
  p
    | Transport across the membrane is generally driven by chemical potential and
    | electrical potential. Energy reaches equilibrium across the membrane in the
    | absence of active transport, and can be described using free energy and the
    | concentrations on either side of the membrane.

section
  h2 10.7 Know the types of transport
  p
    | Transport across lipid membranes occurs via multiple mechanisms:
  ul
    li Non-mediated
    li Mediated
  p
    | In non-mediated transport (passive diffusion), ions and molecules can flow
    | through the membrane due to difference in gradients across the membrane, such as
    | electrochemical gradients.
  p
    | Mediated, or active, transport (facilited diffusion) uses an active input of
    | energy to aid the movement of ions and molecules, sometimes against gradients.
    | Active transport mechanisms include ionophores, porins, and conformation-changing proteins.

  br
  h2 10.8 Understand how Na+/K+-ATPase work.
  p
    | One important active-transport protein is NA+/K+ ATPase, a protein found in
    | cellular membranes that maintains concentrations of NA+ and K+ inside and outside the
    | cell. This protein is found in all organs but is particularly important in the brain
    | where it drives many neurochemical processes.
  p
    | This protein requires an input of energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis, which
    | pushes Na+ out of the cell and pulls K+ ions into the cell. This process accounts
    | for a massive portion of the organism's energy requirements and is used throughout the body.
